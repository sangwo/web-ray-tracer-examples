<img src="./diffuse.png" alt="red and blue spheres with diffuse shading" width="500">

**diffuse + ambient**

<img src="./ambient.png" alt="red and blue spheres with diffuse and ambient" width="500">

**diffuse + ambient + specular**

<img src="./specular.png" alt="red and blue spheres with diffuse, ambient, specular" width="500">
Notice the difference in highlights of the two spheres; the red sphere's shininess is set to 50 while the blue sphere's shininess is set to 200.
